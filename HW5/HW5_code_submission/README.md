Instructions: 
1. Make sure you have the right version of python. Install all the packages that we had to have installed 
2. Download all the data files for both spam and titanic 
3. Copy the code and Run the script and all the plots will be plotted and you will get all the results that I got. 
4. Also make sure you set the random seed to 150 for titanic and 200 for spam
5. You can run the whole decision_tree_starter.py file at once to tune the hyperparameters and run the model with my tuned hyperparameters. Once you run the whole code once and have the values of the hyperparameters, then you can comment the section of the file where I tune hyperparamenters and run the model again with the values that the hyperparameter tuning generated.
