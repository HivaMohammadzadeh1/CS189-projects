Instructions: 
1. Make sure you have the right version of python. Install all the packages that we had to have installed 
2. Download all the data files 
3. Copy the code and Run the script and all the plots will be plotted and you will get all the results that I got. 
4. For Questions 3 and 4, it might be easier if you convert my file into a .ipynb file but .py also works ok.
